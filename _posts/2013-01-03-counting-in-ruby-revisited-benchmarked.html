After writing the post a while back on <a href="http://m635j520.blogspot.com/2012/12/un-deux-tscha-tscha-or-counting-in-ruby.html" target="_blank">counting in Ruby</a> I wondered if the two different implementations I outlined had similar runtimes. Inspired by <a href="http://gistflow.com/posts/136-benchmarking-with-ruby" target="_blank">this post by makaroni4</a>&nbsp;I went ahead and wrote the following little "benchmarker":<br /><div class="gistLoad" data-id="4445874" id="gist-4445874">Loading...</div>So, you see the block centered implementation is about 20% faster than my initial one.
