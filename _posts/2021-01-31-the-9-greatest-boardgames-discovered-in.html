  <p>2020 was an… interesting… year boardgamewise, and in this post I'll summarize some of my key findings, but first, some stats:</p><ul style="text-align: left;">   <li>I played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#/media/File:Answer_to_Life.png" target="_blank">42</a>… things… for the first time according to <a href="https://www.bgstatsapp.com/">BG Stats</a>.       8 of them were expansions, so 34 new games, then. (Down from 97/88 last year.)    </li>   <li>Interestingly, 8 of       my top 10 most played games of 2019 was new-to-me games, whereas in 2020       it was the opposite – only 2 of them were new-to-me.&nbsp;    </li>   <li>Every year, since I       started logging my board game plays semi-consistently back in 2013,       more than half of all games played has been new-to-me. In 2020 it fell       below one third. I seem to have been more keen to show my kids the       classics than seeking out new games in these confined times… (Or, maybe       even more importantly, I have hardly been to local board game cafés to       test new games, I have hardly rented new games from our friendly board       game rental store, I have hardly played games at friend’s places – new       or old, and I didn’t go to Spiel in Essen, nor <a href="https://www.octogones.org/" target="_blank">Octogônes</a>… What a year…)&nbsp;    </li>   <li>On top of       this, my <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/953084/whats-your-h-index" target="_blank">H-index</a> <i>almost </i>fell to 7 (From 8 in 2017, 2018, and 2019), but       I got a last game of Wingspan in on the last day of the year to bring       it back up to 8… Pfiu!    </li></ul><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Bo5eBniIqA4/YBcX-8cSj3I/AAAAAAADkhQ/_hZVPvPsajo38ELMMyw1nAaAHm3oBmjawCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/743E9472-912F-4D97-8C1F-71B4275E896E.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2048" data-original-width="2048" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Bo5eBniIqA4/YBcX-8cSj3I/AAAAAAADkhQ/_hZVPvPsajo38ELMMyw1nAaAHm3oBmjawCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/743E9472-912F-4D97-8C1F-71B4275E896E.jpg" />&nbsp;</a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>Anyway, enough numbers, here’s my list of noteworthy new-to-me games from 2020. (As usual this is not really my favourite nine games, but rather a kind of optimal games library of games I played in 2020. Horses for courses.) <p></p><p></p><h2 id="filler-games">Filler games <br /></h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CHyfAR-B4CJ/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1080" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BGCVNlTcO-A/YBcYdkH7tDI/AAAAAAADkiE/1TlHlOyzlggIQWc6fWDvpOZWNFB7uDtWwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/126169492_127722602211179_290804643519132773_n.jpg" /></a></div><p></p><p>First game on the list is <i><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/251412">On Tour</a></i>   – a game from 2019 (I kickstarted the 2020 re-edition with the European    map, though). I love how this game can be explained in one minute, but    is full of fascinating concepts and hard decisions… It is a    roll-and-flip-and write – it uses <i>both</i> the chaotic radomness of    dice as well as the orderly randomness of cards to dictate what you can    do each round. The main game-play loop is basically an adaptation of    the NP-hard travelling salesman problem from computer science in-fame –    you try to optimize a rock and roll tour across the US, or, in the    latest edition, Europe. Also, the components are great, it scales well,    and is perfectly suited for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CHyfAR-B4CJ/">web cam play</a>. (More on this in this <a>earlier blog post</a>.) </p><p style="text-align: left;"><i>Favourite mechanism: The natural way that the wild numbers    appears – either by drawing 3 of the same region cards, or rolling a    double. Such an elegant solution to a problem – choice, by adding    something super valuable – a wild number.</i></p><p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKjGf7Uhi4D/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1080" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HJOAM4RE5Lc/YBcYjKruAXI/AAAAAAADkiI/zfkX5t1ZYGMqhzMMmCR4m_WI6yoERBeyQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/142593512_772112336751066_5552954794921650107_n.jpg" /></a></div><p></p><p>The second filler game I want to highlight is another 2019 sortie, but really took off in 2020: <i><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284083">The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine</a></i>   – a mission based cooperative trick taking game with a space theme… (It    should be a filler, but one of my very few board game evenings with    friends at home, turned into a The Crew evening instead. It’s so easy to    try the next level, or retry the one we just failed… One more round!) </p><p style="text-align: left;"><i>Favourite mechanism: The book of missions that you can pick and chose from at whim marries perfectly the coop nature of this game.</i></p><h2 id="gateway-games">Gateway games</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKheA4GhvJp/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1080" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eAiovFgdYrI/YBcYoxB7f8I/AAAAAAADkiM/kObhA_zcJCMZ4oUdgOZ4CldkniTuFHEFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/142763366_165283151766212_2249739082500903770_n.jpg" /></a></div><p></p><p>Stepping into the gateway game part of this list we first find another well received kickstarter: <i><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/283155">Calico</a></i>.    This game looks cute and simple and can be explained in two and a half    minute, but is really crunchy and thinky. (Not for the AP-prone, but for    those there’s the excellent solo mode…)  </p><p style="text-align: left;"><i>Favourite mechanism: The bonus scoring tiles that you can try to solve using colour, pattern or, if you really want to push your luck and power of observation, both, leads to some really brain-burny moments.</i></p><p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-AJmgQqnDV/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1080" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-56XSv8NFA0c/YBcYuXWqrRI/AAAAAAADkiU/Sq47vBk_DFUlLb4BNZebqDT9w5yRqIZfACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/90181690_207596783636230_1693437767867556069_n.jpg" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>Some years ago I was introduced to a tiny computer came called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Town">Triple Town</a>, from <a href="https://spryfox.com/">Spry Fox</a>.    A fascinating match-3+ where you keep adding tiles to a grid while    trying to not run out of space. The last tile you add adjacent to two or    more similar tiles are replaced by an upgraded version of the tile, and    the others removed to make room for more. This kind of spatial puzzle    feels a lot like a spiritual predecessor to <i><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/265736">Tiny Towns</a></i>   (or Petites Bourgades as my copy is called). My favourite gateway    weight game of 2020. Here you place resources on a grid trying to match    patterns dictated by cards representing various buildings with a    plethora of effects. The game flows really well with simultaneous play,    you have quite many combinations of buildings to play with, and you have    different play modes – there’s even a solo variant! (I’ve also invented    an unofficial mode without monuments to play with the youngest of the    household.)  </p><p style="text-align: left;"><i>Favourite mechanism: The spatial puzzle of replacing    resources with buildings is really neat and leads to some really hard    decisions and long term planning. </i></p><p>One of the game modes almost resemble bingo – you draw resource cards    and announce it to all players that have to place that resource that    round (that you can also play over <a>webcam</a>), which brings us to the next game on this list… </p><h2 id="gateway-games_1">Gateway+ games</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CI_kTFJh50i/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" data-original-height="1079" data-original-width="1080" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-htOGQTGvCSY/YBcY0Wks_BI/AAAAAAADkic/zuaKNpyVbp4-JatLXK62sTzuvxIYsNzrQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/131041905_119523566650361_2244997229934596383_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><p></p><p>When I was introduced to Rise of Augustus at Essen back in 2013, it…    fell a bit flat… The bingo mechanic felt too much like… well… Bingo! <i><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/279254">Ecos: First Continent</a></i> revisits this, but, somehow, it works! Maybe it’s because the cards that you activate with the resources drawn from a bag <i>combo</i> better – forming potential cascading effects upon effects? Maybe it is what you can do when you get resources you <i>don’t</i>   need or want? Maybe the interaction and the emerging gameplay – and    game landscape – that results from whatever cards come into in play in    each game is more interesting? Maybe the theme is more appealing? (…or    maybe I should revisit Augustus?) Anyway, I’ve really enjoyed my    sessions of Ecos. Simultaneous play makes the game zoom along. </p><p style="text-align: left;"><i>Favourite mechanism: The solution to getting resources you    don’t need – that you can use it to make progress on drafting or playing    a new card – is really elegant to counter the random nature of the    bingo mechanic.</i></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKtWWapB29x/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1080" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3b70Dj5gN68/YBcY5KePU3I/AAAAAAADkik/DDGfj38r58UPfekCI1U4oUY37MZPJVDogCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/144188376_782681172372832_2583787808444982117_n.jpg" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>Like I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIpoHUsh1Xe/">mentioned on my instagram account back in December</a>, <i><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/271324">It’s a Wonderful World</a></i> is a weird one. First time I played it at <a href="http://www.barnade.com/">@barnadelyon</a>   with some friends it didn’t make much of an impression. It was a fine    streamlined drafting game ala 7 Wonders. Then, some time later I had a,    seemingly, amazing idea for a board game design, so I sat down with my    ideas notebook and sketched it out. A drafting game where you had better    reasons for… “hate drafting”… Enter proper multi-use cards! After a    while I realized that this game I was about to make looked more and more    like a game I had played before. And it was. It was It’s a Wonderful    World. So I bought it at my FLGS <a href="https://www.trollune.fr/">@trollune_la_boutique</a>   and played it again. And, lo and behold, it was great.  Even the solo    mode works great (a real boon in 2020)! In a drafting game! All in all,    this has been the game I have spent the most time in in 2020. (I realize    this <i>is</i> a bit of creative book-keeping, since I <i>technically</i>   discovered the game in 2019, but, hey, I make the rules here. Also,    I’ve enjoyed two of the three expansions released in 2020 (again as part    of a kickstarter)…) </p><p style="text-align: left;"><i>Favourite mechanism: One thing this adds to the mix is the    resource cubes that, since they are produced in a certain order, lets    you creatively combo events and create chains of card resolutions. So    rewarding.</i></p><h2 id="enthusiast-games">Enthusiast games</h2><p><i></i></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKro-k9hrY3/https://www.instagram.com/p/CKro-k9hrY3/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1080" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tg0ImfMWcPI/YBcY95Vgj2I/AAAAAAADkio/i15_uRCsfIIlLqJSJgPTyjVgSUCA7uULgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/144149486_237003994643180_8309848046867008548_n.jpg" /></a></i></div><i><br /></i><p></p><p><i><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/276025">Maracaibo</a></i> was just shy of ending up in the top 10 part of my super-objective-top-25-games-of-all-time that I created last December, at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CI1OmiyhP_F/">11th place</a>.    And, as I pointed out, this is my second favourite Pfister rondel style    game. Instead of herding cows you’re travelling around in the Caribbean    during the age of pirates – with some tableau building and multi-use    cards thrown in. Great stuff. This is also the first big box game from    this designer in my collection with a solo mode. And a great one at    that. It has been fun to explore the – thankfully, non destructive –    campaign mode. (I haven’t played through the whole thing as I restarted    it with my son after some solo exploration at first.) </p><p style="text-align: left;"><i>Favourite mechanism: I really like the fact that the rondel    “stops” for everyone if someone finishes a round. It leads to some    really hard timing related decisions.</i></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKq8xQdB9AQ/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1080" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s4bbMD2CnM0/YBcZB4Ml51I/AAAAAAADki4/xzGYZQDFWoAbtEWMLMmqV3utNfDbpSDJwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/144850686_249803383190554_7044585037609614716_n.jpg" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>When I created my above mentioned list of favourite games, I put <i><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266810">Paladins of the West Kingdom</a></i> on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CId2t18hw-e/">the 21st place</a>   just below Viscounts from the same Kingdom. Having played it some more I    realized it deserved one of the two enthusiast game slots on this list…    (Just barely beating these very same Viscounts…)  </p><p style="text-align: left;"><i>Favourite mechanism: You can be competing for the same    cards/positions on the map, even with very different strategies, since,    for example, invaders can either be battled (if you go for military    strength) or converted (if you go for faith).</i></p><h2 id="solo-game">Solo game</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7zL1oLIcWy/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1080" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9Gt7CoXyc88/YBcZG7LcgJI/AAAAAAADkjA/cH96-5sW41A-5plR6cHL_0RqOUXZ_HpGQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/81907092_201097327993797_3931573034608561097_n.jpg" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>Even though I’ve only gotten to play the solitaire variant, <i><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/184267">On Mars</a></i> is my game of the year. (This reached the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CI7n8DXhfRQ/">8th place on my super-objective-top-25-games-of-all-time list</a>.)    “On Mars is quite possibly the heaviest of the games on my top 25. I’ve    only been alone on Mars — playing the solitaire variant —, admittedly,    since it arrived at my doorstep this… year, so it might float even    higher or plummet like a stone next ranking around, but currently it    hovers nicely here in the 8th spot. System within system — like the    visual language of Guillermo del Toro turned into game design.    Incredibly impressive! Bravo <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vitallacerda/">@vitallacerda</a>!” </p><p style="text-align: left;"><i>Favourite mechanism: The duality of what you can do on    surface versus what you can do in orbit, along with the need for the    shuttle to change between them, is really elegant and leads to oh so    many complicated multilemmas… </i></p><p>So, there you have it. My “Ludoteca Ideale” of 2020… Now for some honourable mentions!</p><h2 id="honourable-mentions-sorted-alphabetically">Honourable mentions (sorted alphabetically)</h2><ul>   <li>Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small – Agricola re-imagined as a       quick small 2P game without the starvation. (This has been sitting on my       shelf of shame since, well, ages.)    </li>   <li>Boomerang: Europe – A quick, simple draft-and-write from the ever so prolific Scott Almes.</li>   <li>Coffee Roaster – A great solitaire bag builder with the best theme       in my collection - coffee roasting. I have the second edition with       fabulous components and art. (In the first draft of this post, this game       was actually my solo game of the year. (It <i>is</i> the best pure solitaire game I played in 2020.))    </li>   <li>Draftosaurus – Draft dinosaur meeples to create a Jurassic park. (Not that one.)</li>   <li>Dream Catcher – The third best new-to-me children game I played in 2020.</li>   <li>Ghost Adventure – the second best new-to-me children game I played in 2020.</li>   <li>Hokkaido – revisiting the tile laying landscape building card game of Honshu.</li>   <li>La Isla – Another game that had been sitting on my shelf of shame for too long. </li>   <li>Mini Express – A follow up to Mini Rails (among last year’s       honourable mentions) that takes another stab at streamlining the 18xx       genre into a gateway game. I’ve only played this one virtually on       Tabletopia, but it worked really well. (One of two new-to-me games that I       <i>only</i> got to play virtually.) I hope to get to play a physical version at some point.    </li>   <li>Oceans – A great tableau builder with a evolution theme, although       it, so far, seems to fall a bit short of it’s older sister Evolution       (especially with the Climate extension).    </li>   <li>Oriflamme – A quick bluffing game of murdering with a fascinating chose when you want to reveal card mechanism.</li>   <li>Point Salad – Behind this humorous meta name is actually a great little card game with interesting card drafting mechanics. </li>   <li>Q.E. – My favourite aucion game discovery in 2020. Super simple, but       full of bluffing and double guessing – with a very clever ‘bid whatever       you want’ mechanic. Great fun.    </li>   <li>The Quiet Year – A story generator perfect for solitary or duet play       – using a regular deck of cards, some dice, a paper, pencils, a lookup       table – and some imagination.    </li>   <li>Trek 12 – Another great roll and write. Co-authored by Bruno Cathala.</li>   <li>Vintage – I got to test this in Cannes during FIJ. A great point       salady set collection game from Bruno Faidutti with some very       interesting drafting mechanics. The art direction is also very fitting.    </li>   <li>Viscounts of the West Kingdom – The game that was the closest to end       up on the list above. I’ve only played it solitaire, though… (Maybe       I’ll end up breaking my own rules next year around and add it to the       2021 list. Who knows!) This is a mix of so many mechanics that it made       me think of the first time I met Great Western Trail – Even some of the       mechanics overlap! Rondel movement, deck builder, (sliding) tableau       builder, area control, resource management, set collection, etc – but,       just like in GWT, they click! when you start playing.    </li>   <li>Welcome to New Las Vegas – Follow up to one of my most played games       of all time “Welcome to…” is a slightly… heavier… affair (to the extent a       random-write can be heavy), but, still, great fun.    </li>   <li>Zombie Kidz Evolution – The bezt new-to-me children game I played in       2020. A cooperative legacy game with ztickers and zombies – and an ever       evolving rule zet. My most played game of 2020 – in number of playz.    </li></ul><h2 id="the-games-i-look-forward-the-most-to-play-in-2021">The games I look forward the most to play in 2021</h2><ul>   <li>Darwin’s Voyage – I have recently Kickstarted this – let’s hope it lives up to the hype…</li>   <li>Expedition to Newdale – Pfister revisiting some mechanics of his       excellent Oh My Goods (one of the games I have played the most solo),       but with… components (and retaining a solitaire mode). (Spoiler alert!       It’s great! My third favourite Pfister of all time?)    </li>   <li>Anno 1800 – Martin Wallace(!)’s take on the Anno video games series…</li>   <li>Praga Caput Regni – Rondel perfection?</li>   <li>Lost Ruins of Arnak – Deck builder and worker placement with a theme? Yes, please!</li>   <li>Mariposas – this arrived in the house during the end of year festivities…</li>   <li>Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun – </li>   <li>My City – The latest city building, pentomino, bingo game from Dr Knizia.</li>   <li>Whistle Mountain – Spiritual successor to a Whistle Stop – a “train game” I’ve always wanted to try.</li>   <li>Hallertau – Uwe Rosenberg</li>   <li>Tiny Epic Pirates – I think this Marauders-light (with, as the       Zeitgeist dictates, a rondel front and center) from Scott Almes will       appeal to people of all ages in this household. (So I kickstarted it a       while back…)    </li>   <li>Under Falling Skies – Space invaders as a solitaire board game – soon to be released here in France.</li>   <li>The Search for Planet X – Solitaire (that can be played <i>coop</i>…)</li>   <li>The Castles of Tuscany – Stefan Feld revisiting the sauce of one of       my favourite discoveries of 2019, but with a big enough twist to make it       interesting…?    </li>   <li>Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 – I haven’t gotten to play any of the Pandemic Legacy games yet…</li>   <li>Santa Monica</li>   <li>...and!
