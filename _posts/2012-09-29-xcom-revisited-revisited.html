<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mortenjohs/7347376224/" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" title="Beach House @ L'Epicérie by mortenjohs, on Flickr"><img alt="Beach House @ L'Epicérie" height="375" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8015/7347376224_be6f1165a5.jpg" width="500" /></a> I figured I should give the XCOM demo another shot tonight, attempting what I thought was another level - since the game lets you choose to do either a mission in the US or China.<br /><br />Turned out to be the same level. Only skinned slightly differently. Fair enough. Also, I thought I could change the difficulty level, but alas, no. (Afterwards I found a guide on how to do it though: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/655782-/64136437">http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/655782-/64136437</a>&nbsp;(Not that I have tested it...))<br /><br />Also, I figured I would try to capture one of the&nbsp;<strike>Sid M</strike>&nbsp;Thin Men alive. (Since the cute German scientist asked me nicely, but I just fragged them to smithereens last playthrough.) If I understand well, this is not possible in the demo, due to lack of things to stun things.<br /><br />Anyway - after two play-throughs I'm looking even more forward to the full game. Excellent. (If only it was delivered with a fair dose of time.)
