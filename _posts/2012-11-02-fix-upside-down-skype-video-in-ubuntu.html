<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mortenjohs/8119893255/" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="Holland by mortenjohs, on Flickr"><img alt="Holland" height="375" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8189/8119893255_ea885ba176.jpg" width="500" /></a><span style="font-family: inherit;">When launching Skype in&nbsp;64-bit&nbsp;Ubuntu 12.10 on my Asus U35J the webcam image was all topsy-turvy. Since I don't live in Australia, or something (tsk-tsk), this was not really cutting it for me.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Some quick googling led me to this forum post:&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.pcpitstop.com/index.php?/topic/198236-why-is-my-skype-video-showing-upside-down/">http://forums.pcpitstop.com/index.php?/topic/198236-why-is-my-skype-video-showing-upside-down/</a>&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">After making sure that the necessary packages was installed (notably&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; line-height: 22px;">libv4l-0) I adapted the command from the forum post to:</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 22px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">and voila, the image was OK.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Next step is for this to be set to default, which seems to be outlined here (in steps 2 and 3):&nbsp;<a href="http://pc-freak.net/blog/how-to-fix-upside-down-inverted-web-camera-laptop-asus-k51ac-issue-on-ubuntu-linux-and-debian-gnu-linux/">http://pc-freak.net/blog/how-to-fix-upside-down-inverted-web-camera-laptop-asus-k51ac-issue-on-ubuntu-linux-and-debian-gnu-linux/</a>&nbsp;(Actually this post seems to cover most of what is useful from the forum post above...)</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">UPDATE (19/04/2013): Since my laptop was working fine, I decided it was about time to fix it. Also I wanted to use Cinnamon instead of Unity, as the latter had gotten more and more on my nerves. (A long story in itself.) I followed some instructions on how to get rid of lots of unwanted stuff and end up with something akin to a Lubuntu install. And lo and behold, it was nice... Until I started Skype today. The camera was topsy turvy again and the preloading of this .so from above resulted in an error. The file was missing. I found that I had the 64-bit version hanging around in a parallel folder and naively tried to load that instead, but alas, Skype seems to be a 32-bit beast, so that didn't work. The solution would be to (re)install the 32-bit libraries with:</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">sudo apt get install ia32-libs</span></span><br /><br />And the solution outlined above works like a charm again.
