Sometimes on my mac, sometimes on a linux laptop, sometimes on a windows machine. Anyway, I have my course files in my Dropbox and pick them up from there as needed on the various OSes. Problem was when opening the my scala projects in eclipse in OSX after compiling them under Windows, I got a cryptic "</span>error in scala compiler null<span style="font-family: inherit;">" and was unable to clean and (re)compile my scala programs. I realised that I was running JDK 6 on my mac and JDK 7 on anything else, so I figured that might have something to do with it.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">After following <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/426700/mary-hamlin" target="_blank">Mary Hamlin</a>'s answer here:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7669899/how-to-run-eclipse-indigo-on-jdk-1-7-on-osx">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7669899/how-to-run-eclipse-indigo-on-jdk-1-7-on-osx</a> my problems seems to be over.&nbsp;Thanks Mary!<br /><br />To the functional programming mobile!
