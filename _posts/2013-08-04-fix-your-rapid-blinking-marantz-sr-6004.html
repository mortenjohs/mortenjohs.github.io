A couple of years ago my (most of the time excellent) Maranz SR6004 acted up. It did't want to turn itself on. Properly. Just stood there and blinked rapidly. Its little red light that is. At me.&nbsp;The solution was so simple that I didn't bother to write it down as I was sure to remember it. Alas, no. Some weeks ago it did it again. (Can it be the heat?) Just stood there blinking rapidly at me. The manual just said - as it said last time around - that it was time to return the unit to it's maker. Or similar.<br /><br />Some googling led me to this page:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allquests.com/question/4056803/Marantz-XXX4-Series-Failure-Issues.html">http://www.allquests.com/question/4056803/Marantz-XXX4-Series-Failure-Issues.html</a>&nbsp;The technical term for what I had experienced seems to be "The Pop of Death". AÃ¯e.<br /><br />But!, humongous letters said:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b style="background-color: #f7f7ff; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: xx-large;"><span style="color: red;">YOU CAN SOMETIMES RESET THE UNIT BY PRESSING SURR MODE, CLEAR AND EXIT SIMULTANEOUSLY</span></b></blockquote><br />And so I did. And so it was fixed. And all was well. (And now I have written it down for the next time.)
