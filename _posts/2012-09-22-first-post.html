<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mortenjohs/7862185986/" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="Gress by mortenjohs, on Flickr"><img alt="Gress" height="332" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7273/7862185986_92b5bc8b41.jpg" width="500" /></a>This is my fourth attempt at blogging, I think... The first one was a quite active, at least&nbsp;in the beginning, blog on video games running from 2005 to 2009 - called "gglob", yes "gglob". &nbsp;Catchy! (I wonder what the waybackmachine has to say about this. (Aha!: &nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051026113353/http://gglob.ath.cx/" target="_blank">2005</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090511183846/http://gglob.mortenjohs.net/?" target="_blank">2009</a>&nbsp;(I could have sworn the layout looked better back then...)) The second one was a blog/cms-thingy on music making - running from 2006ish to 2009ish. (Not much on the waybackmachine on that one.) The third one was started mid 2010, is still going strong, and is a hidden, collaborative (co-authored with my better half) blog about the life of our son.<br /><br />This one will be about code, hacks, life, music, the universe, and everything. I hope. Basically I'll try to write up solutions to problems I encounter so that I won't have to solve them again (from scratch at least). And maybe others can benefit as well. Who knows.<br /><br />Anyway, "Velkommen".
