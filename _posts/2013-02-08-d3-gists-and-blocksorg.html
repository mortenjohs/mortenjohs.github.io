Yesterday I stumbled upon a very useful tool while (trying to) teach(ing) myself D3, namely <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/" target="_blank">http://bl.ocks.org</a>.&nbsp;This lets you access, and preview, your webby gists in a browser - just by browsing to&nbsp;http://bl.ocks.org/&lt;gist-id&gt;. Most handy!<br />(The only minor down side is that there seems to be a slight latency if you update your gist before it updates on bl.ocks.org.)
