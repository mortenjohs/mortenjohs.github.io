Magic. Today when I sat down to start the course on "General Game Playing" that I have signed up for, but, alas, not (yet) found much time for, I thought of that piece of code and wondered if I, with my new knowledge of JavaScript, could whip up something like that. (Also I couldn't find Johannes' original one.)<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MHqWbSs7cEg/UmTkXvsLZ2I/AAAAAAABS3k/FXm_XjRKVXg/s1600/promo.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="250" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MHqWbSs7cEg/UmTkXvsLZ2I/AAAAAAABS3k/FXm_XjRKVXg/s400/promo.png" width="400" /></a>I quickly hacked together something this afternoon over a flat white in a hipster cafe here in Lyon. And lo and behold it worked. Then I extended the functionality to also show minutes and seconds of unwatched video - as well as total overall counters for the entire course. Now each lesson heading reads "Lesson N - Name [time remaining/total time]" instead of just "Lesson N - Name". (The <a href="https://gist.github.com/mortenjohs/7075320" target="_blank">gist</a> of it.)<br /><br />Having done that I wondered how difficult it would be to make it into a Chrome extension that would just automagically run this script on all my, and maybe other's, Coursera video listings. That (seems to have gone|went) fairly well and the extension can be installed from here:&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coursera-video-time-summa/gncpkgpieinlhlcemphffhkleahblekl">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coursera-video-time-summa/gncpkgpieinlhlcemphffhkleahblekl</a><br /><br />Now back to the General Game Playing...
