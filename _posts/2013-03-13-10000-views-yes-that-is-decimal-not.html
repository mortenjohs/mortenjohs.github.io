Next week this little blog experiment will turn 6 months, and yesterday it passed 10000 views (sans counting my own revisits - in theory), so I guess some of the things I put up here are useful to others as well (or Google's counting is different than how others might do this)...<br />Anyways: thanks.<br /><b>Update 27/09/2013</b>: 2 posts (and six months) later and the count has passed 20000...
