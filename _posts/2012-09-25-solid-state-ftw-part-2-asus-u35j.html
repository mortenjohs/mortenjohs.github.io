This is what I did.<br /><br />I went for a 128 Gb CRUCIAL SSD m4 2,5" with a noname external 2,5" drive case. I tore out the old 600Gb-ish drive from the laptop, put it in the external case, and fit the new drive in its place. "Klok av skade", I went for installing windows first. (The Windows 98 installer overwrote my SuSE back in the day...)<br /><h4>Windows 7</h4>Since this Asus doesn't have an optical drive, I couldn't generate the "Recovery disc(s)" needed to reinstall the operating system. (Clever Asus.) The way I got around that was to boot Ubuntu 12.04 from a USB-stick, used gparted to partition the SDD (with a primary partition, a logical, and a linux swap one) and copy the recovery partition from the (now) external drive to the first partition on the SSD drive. Afterwards I rebooted holding F9 to launch the recovery. And it worked! (It took me a while to realize that I had to hold down F9 even though the recovery partition booted (because it was the only partition there), but failed to install without this magic button.) I asked the windows installer to use the whole HD (leaving the recovery partition be). After some time and a gazillion reboots I had a windows install up and running (full of Asus bloatware - but that is for another post).<br /><br />Some additional points:<br /><ul><li>Ninite is your friend.&nbsp;<a href="http://ninite.com/" target="_blank">http://ninite.com/</a></li><li>So is Railsinstaller.&nbsp;<a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">http://railsinstaller.org/</a></li><li>I'm considering putting Steam games on an external HD and symlinking to them... (For now I have just installed the most important ones - CivV, Bastion, Frozen Synapse, and SpaceChem on the SSD.) Savegames are already symlinked to a Dropbox-folder.</li></ul><h4>Ubuntu 12.04</h4>I replaced the 20 GB recovery partition from the step above with Ubuntu. Easy peasy. Booted from the USB stick. Installed.<br /><br />Some points:<br /><ul><li>Boots grub to login in less then 6 seconds.</li><li>Most things (that I have tested) works out of the box.</li><ul><li>Two-finger scrolling needs to be set up in the Mouse Preferences.</li></ul><li>I don't use the nvidia-card, just the intel one - to save battery, since anyway, I don't plan to game on the linux part of the laptop. (Till Steam releases their Linux client.)</li><li>Sleep works, hibernation doesn't. (Not really a problem, methinks.)</li></ul><h4>Common</h4></div><div>I keep my dropbox files in one place and have added some symlinks in both OSs to link to them.</div>
